                <strong>Soils suitable for growing Basmati Rice from seed:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;Soils with good drainage facilities should be preferred. 
            Required soil pH is 5.0-8.0. 
            Avoid soils with poor drainage and saline in nature."
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            <span style="color: burlywood;">
                <strong>Crop rotations in Basmati rice farming:-</strong>
            </span><br>

        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            <span style="color: burlywood;">
                <strong>Time of Nursery Sowing:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;For late maturing types nursery should be sown during second fort night of June and for early maturing types nursery was sown during first fort night of June."

                <strong>Unpuddled direct seeded Basmati rice:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            <p>We can grow basmati rice by direct sowing by practicing the following points.</p>
                <ul style="color:white;padding-left: 140px;font-size: 20px;">
                <li>Sowing of basmati rice by direct seeding only in medium to heavy textured soils.</li>
                <li>Proper control of weeds is important for raising a healthy crop of direct seeded basmati rice.</li>
                <li>Ensure its proper establishment by sowing seeds with tractor drawn rice drill<strong>.</strong><strong> </strong></li>
                </ul>

        <p>
            <span style="color: burlywood;">
                <strong>The seed rate for growing Basmati Rice from seed:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;8 to 10 kg seed per acre with the row to row spacing of 20cm."
        </p><br><br>
        <p>
            <span style="color: burlywood;">
                <strong>Transplanting time in Basmati Rice farming:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;Time of transplanting is an important factor in determining the yield and quality of the Basmati rice. 
            Basmati 386 and Basmati 370 if transplanted too early have a prolonged vegetative phase resulting into a leafy and tall crop. 
            Such crop is highly prone to lodging because of excessive vegetative growth and height. 
            To prevent lodging, lopping of the upper half of crop canopy after 45 days of transplanting may be done. 
            Further it also reduce stem borer damage. 
            Being photoperiod sensitive these will flower when a specific day length was met. 
            The early transplanted crop also experiences high temperature at flowering which in result lowers the cooking quality. 
            Proper time of transplanting for Basmati 386 and Basmati 370 is second fortnight of July. 
            Punjab Mehak 1, Punjab Basmati 2, Pusa Basmati 1121, Super Basmati and Pusa Basmati No. 1 etc. 
            may be transplanted during first fortnight of July. 
            The seedlings of 25-35 days old with 5-6 leaves stage are suitable for transplanting in to main field. 
            Transplanting old seedling cause reduced tillering and yield in basmati rice cultivation."

                <strong>The method of Transplanting in Basmati Rice farming:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;The nursery should be irrigated before uprooting the seedlings. 
            Seedlings should be transplanted carefully after washing to remove the mud with a spacing of 20 x 15 cm (33 hills/sq. metre) in well puddled field."

        <p>
            <span style="color: burlywood;">
                <strong>Fertilizer Application or Fertilizer management in Basmati Rice farming:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;High doses of nitrogen cause the crop to prone lodging by causing excessive vegetative growth which results in a reduction in yield. Application of 75 kg of superphosphate per acre prior to last puddling is recommended.  Broadcasting of 18 kg urea per acre in two splits is recommended. The first dose needs to be applied after three weeks and the second, six weeks after transplanting. Nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied when water is not standing in the field if possible. Organic manures have to be added before last ploughing to the soil."

            Rice stemborers : <br>The larvae of these insects bore into the stem and cause damage from
            July to October. The affected young plants show dead-hearts (yellowing and drying of central shoot)
            whereas the old ones produce empty earheads which turn white and stand erect. The fields showing more
            than 5% dead hearts (economic threshold level) should be sprayed with 350 ml of Hostathion 40 EC
            (triazophos) or 560 ml of Monocil 36 SL (monocrotophos) or 1 litre of
            Coroban/Dursban/Lethal/Chlorguard/Durmet/Classic/Force 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) in 100 litres of water

            economic threshold level.<br><br>
            Leaf folder :<br> The larvae fold the leaves, eat out the green tissue and produce white
            streaks. The damage is highest during August-October. Spray the crop when the leaf damage
            reaches 10 per cent (ETL) with 350 ml of Hostathion 40 EC (triazophos) or one litre of Coroban/
            Durmet/ Force 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) or 560 ml of Monocil 36 SL (monocrotophos) in 100 litres of water

            Plant hoppers :<br> These hoppers include, whitebacked plant hopper and brown planthopper.
            Both nymphs and adults of these pests suck the cell sap particularly from the leaf-sheath from July to
            October. The crop dries up in patches. As the plants dry up, the hoppers migrate to the adjoining plants
            and kill them. In a few days, the area of the dry patches enlarge. To minimise the damage by whitebacked
            planthopper, grow PAU 201 which is moderatelsssy resistant to this insect. About one month after
            transplanting, a few plants in the field should be slightly tilted and tapped 2 or 3 times at the base at
            weekly interval. If minimum 5 plant hoppers per hill are<br>
            seen floating in the water, only then the crop should be treated with insecticide. The plant hoppers can be
            controlled by spraying 40 ml Confidor 200 SL (imidacloprid) or 800 ml Ekalux/Quinguard 25 EC
            (quinalphos) or one litre Coroban/Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) or 560 ml Thiodan/ Endocel 35 EC
            (endosulfan) in 100 litres of water per acre. Repeat the spray if necessary.
            For better effectiveness, direct the spray towards the base of the plants. If the damage is noticed at
            hopper burn stage, treat the affected spots along with their 3-4 metre periphery immediately as these spots
            harbour high population of the insect.<br><br>
            Grasshoppers : <br>The adults and nymphs of the grasshoppers eat the leaves especially in nursery.
            Insecticides recommended for the control of plant hoppers are also effective for
            grasshoppers.<br><br>
            Rice hispa :<br> Rice hispa is a serious pest in some areas of the Gurdaspur and Amritsar
            districts and is also found in the other rice growing areas of the State. The grubs of this pest tunnel into
            the leaves, whereas the adults are exposed feeders. The grubs cause damage by producing bold, white
            streaks on the leaves. If the attack starts in the nursery, clip-off and destroy the leaf tips of the affected
            seedlings before transplanting. On the transplanted crop, spray 120 ml Methyl Parathion 50 EC
            (methylparathion)/560 ml Monocil 36 SL (monocrotophos)/800 ml Ekalux 25 EC (quinalphos)/one litre
            Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) in 100 litres of water per acre with a manually operated sprayer. Repeat
            the spraying if the attack persists.<br><br>
            Rice root weevil : <br>This weevil is a localized pest in the rice area around Rajpura. However,
            this pest has also been observed in some other areas in the State. Its white, legless grubs feed
            on roots in the soil from July to September. The attacked plants turn yellow, stunted and produce only a
            few tillers. Apply any of the following granular insecticides in the standing water :- 3 kg of
            Thimet/Foratox 10G (phorate) per acre.<br><br>
            Warning :<br> Use gloves while applying granular insecticides.<br><br>
            Rice-ear-cutting-caterpillar : <br>The larvae of this insect are gregarious in habit and are
            commonly known as „armyworm‟. The young larvae feed on leaves, leaving only the mid-ribs and items.
            The old larvae cut off the panicles mostly at the base and hence the name “rice ear-cutting caterpillar”.
            This stage of the insect causes serious loss to the paddy crop. The larvae are shy of sunlight and generally
            feed at night. The damage to paddy crop is caused mostly during September to November. The insect can
            be controlled by spraying the crop with 400 ml of Ekalux/Quinguard 25 EC (quinalphos) in 100 litres of
            water per acre. As the pest is nocturnal in behaviour, the spray should be done in evening hours for
            getting better results.<br><br>
            DISEASES :<br><br>
            Bacterial leaf blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae) :<br> Greenish-yellow stripes appear
            along the leaf margins and extend both lengthwise and breadthwise. The leaf starts drying from
            the tip, becomes white in severe cases and dries up completely. The disease sometimes
            attacks the freshly transplanted seedlings which start wilting and in a few days the whole clump
            dries up. The bacterium perpetuates through seed, rice straw, and roots of non-host plants
            during the off-season. <br><br>In order to mitigate the losses, adopt the following measures :<br>
            (i) For the management of bacterial leaf blight, grow rice varieties PR 120, PR 115, PR 113
            and PR 111 which are resistant to most of the pathotypes of bacterial leaf blight pathogen
            or PR-118, PR-116 and PR-114 which are resistant to some of the pathotypes of the bacterial
            leaf blight pathogen.<br>
            (ii) Do not apply excessive dose of nitrogen. Nitrogen should not be applied beyond six weeks
            after transplanting (except when LCC is used).<br>
            (iii) Do not pond water in the field.<br>
            (iv) Treat seed before sowing to kill primary inoculum, see “Seed Treatment” under Agronomic
            Practices.<br>
            (v) (a) Do not grow nursery under shade.<br>
            (b) Rice crop itself should not be grown in the shady area.<br>
            (vi) The growing of rice in the area near Bhusa stack (Kup) should be avoided.<br><br>
            Bacterial leaf streak (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola) :<br> Small translucent streaks appear
            in the interveinal areas of the leaf. The streaks gradually enlarge and turn reddish, when the
            plants near maturity. For control measures, see “Seed treatment” under Agronomic Practices.
            Blast (Pyricularia grisea) : The fungus causes spindle shaped spots with greyish centre and
            brown margin on the leaves at maximum tillering. It also causes brown lesions on the neck of
            the panicle, showing neck rot symptoms and the panicles fall over. The disease is more severe
            on Basmati particularly in the submontaneous areas and under application of heavy nitrogenous
            fertilizers. Spray the affected crop with Indofil Z-78, 75 WP (zineb) @ 500 g per acre in 200 litres
            of water, at the maximum tillering and ear-emergence stages. Alternatively, spray Hinosan
            (ediphenfos) 200 ml in 200 litres of water per acre.<br><br>
            Brown leaf spot (Drechslera oryzae) :<br>It produces oval, eye-shaped spots with a conspicuous
            dark-brown dot in the centre and light brown margin. The spot is surrounded by yellow halo.
            Spots are also produced on the grains. This disease occurs in poor soils, therefore, give
            adequate and balanced nutrition to the crop. To control the disease, give two sprays of Tilt 25
            EC (propiconazole) @ 200ml or Indofil Z-78 (zineb) @500g in 200 litres of water/acre. The first
            spray should be given at boot stage and second after 15 days.<br><br>
            Sheath blight (Corticium sasakii) :<br> Greyish green lesions with purple margin develop on the
            leaf-sheath above the water level. Later, the lesions enlarge and coalesce with other lesions.
            The symptoms are usually not distinct till flowering. Its severe attack results in the poor filling of
            the grains. Burn the rice straw and stubbles after harvesting the affected crop. Avoid the
            excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers. Keep the bunds clean by removing the grass.
            To control sheath blight, spray the crop as soon as the disease is noticed at boot stage with
            Tilt 25 EC @ 200ml or Monceren 250 SC (pencycuron) @ 200 ml or Bavistin 50 WP
            (carbendazim) @ 200g in 200 litres of water per acre by directing the spray towards the base of
            the plant. Give one more spray after 15 days.<br><br>
            Sheath rot (Sarocladium oryzae) : <br>The rot occurs on the uppermost leaf-sheaths where
            oblong to irregular and grey-brown to light-brown lesions develop. The lesions often coalesce to
            cover the entire sheath. In severe cases, young panicles either do not emerge or emerge
            partially. A white-powdery growth of the fungus appears on the panicle inside the sheath. The
            glumes of infected florets are discoloured, dark-red or purple brown to black and often do not fill.
            The fungus over-winters in rice straw and grains. Burn the rice straw after harvesting the
            infected crop. Use disease free seed for sowing. Give two sprays of Tilt 25 EC @ 200 ml or
            Bavistin 50 WP @ 200 gm in 200 litres of water per acre. The first spray should be given at boot
            stage and second after 15 days interval.<br><br>
            Stem rot (Sclerotium oryzae) : <br>The fungus affects the stem at earing and black lesions are
            produced on the sheath at water level. Later on, the stem gets infected and rots leading to
            withering and lodging of the plant. The incidence of this disease has declined on high yielding
            varieties due to improved cultural practices. Prefer to grow tolerant varieties of the Basmati
            group in the infested fields.<br><br>
            False smut (Ustilaginoidea virens) : <br>Its incidence is increasing on high-yielding rice varieties.
            The fungus transforms the individual grains into large greenish velvety spore-balls. High relative
            humidity, rainy and cloudy days during the flowering period increase the incidence of the
            disease.<br>
            The application of organic manures and high dose of nitrogenous fertilizers also increase the
            intensity of attack.<br>
            To control this disease, give first spray of Blitox 50 WP (copper oxychloride) @ 500 g in 200
            litres of water per acre at boot stage of the crop in disease prone areas followed by second
            spray with Tilt 25 EC @ 200 ml in 200 liters of water after 10 days intergal.
            Bunt (also called Kernel Smut) (Neovossia horrida) : Only a few grains in the panicle are
            infected. Frequently, only a part of the grain is replaced by a black powder. Sometimes, entire
            grain is also attacked and the black powder scatters on to other grains or leaves, and this is
            often the easiest way to detect the disease in the field. The disease incidence is more on short
            duration varieties, planted early.<br>
            Also avoid heavy doses of nitrogenous fertilizers. Two sprays of Tilt 25 EC @ 200 ml in 200
            litres of water/ acre at 10% flowering stage and 10 days after should be given for controlling the
            disease."

                <strong>Harvesting and threshing of Basamti Paddy:-</strong>
            </span><br>
            "&nbsp;The crop should be harvested as soon as they mature <em>i.e. 
            </em>when the ears are nearly ripe and the straw has turned up into yellow color. 
            Delaying in harvesting may cause over-ripening and grains shattering. 
            The harvested crop preferably should be threshed on the same day or next day of harvesting. 
            Delayed threshing will cause high shattering losses, 
            reduced head rice recovery and ultimately reduces the market price of the crop. 
            Mostly harvesting should be done 30 to 40 days after flowering. 
            Manual or mechanical harvesting is practiced."
